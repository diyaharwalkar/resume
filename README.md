# Resume — Diya Harwalkar

This is a tiny website that hosts my resume PDF with a clean viewer and download button.

## Files
- `index.html` — the landing page (embeds the PDF).
- `resume.pdf` — the actual resume.

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in a browser.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new public repo on GitHub.
2. Upload `index.html` and `resume.pdf` to the root of the repo.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** and set **Source** to deploy from **main** branch, root (`/`).
4. Save. Your site will be available at the Pages URL for this repo.
